<p class="headings"><b>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:</b></p>
<p class="description">
The aim of this project is to allow for two Android devices to communicate with each other using only their screens and cameras. Assuming their screens and cameras are on the same side, by getting two phones close to each other (e.g., tens of cm), you can have them exchange information (otherwise use a mirror).</p>
<p>
Design and implement the visual link. The expectation is that the link will be slow relatively to the theoretical maximum. That is, relative to the amount of data that can be transferred via the camera (which is enormous). However, it should be not super-slow either. In other words, do not try for the super-simple solution (e.g., slowly blink the entire screen black or white), but rather go for something more refined.
</p>
<br>

<p>
The best solution will be adaptive to the distance between devices: if the devices are close (good SNR), the link can transfer a LOT of data, but as they move apart, the data rate drops gradually. Having this adaptive aspect work well is extra credit.
</p>
